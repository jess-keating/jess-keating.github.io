There is a profile picutre of myself placed on the header of the site. This remains there on the second page as well. There is a 100 word bio on the home page that gives a general description of who I am and things that I like to do. I further added to this on the second page titled, About Me, where I have incldued more detail about myself and my experience. The contact form at the bottom of the home page is functional. To make the form work I have used Formspree. There is a projects section where I have linked my GitHub repository for the She Codes First Website that we build as an example during out HTML and CSS course. I do not currrently have other projects to link here but have included teo placeholders in the meantime and will endevour to link further projects as I complete them in the She Codes Plus course. You will find working URL links to my GitHub and LinkedIn in the footer of the site.
