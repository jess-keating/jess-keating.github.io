      <h1>About Jessica</h1>
      <p>Welcome! I’m Jessica, but you can call me Jess!</p>
      <p>I am a curious, creative, and solutions-oriented human who’s always loved figuring out how things work and how
        they can work better. My path has been anything but linear, but every chapter has been tied together by a
        passion for people, process, and progress.</p>
      <p>I spent years working in high-pressure, high-impact roles across government services, retail, and tech —
        building teams, leading projects, and delivering systems that genuinely help people. What energises me most is
        seeing tangible outcomes, whether that’s a streamlined workflow, an empowered team, or a product that makes
        someone’s day easier.</p>
      <p>Now I’m leaning further into the world of tech and development, following a long-standing interest that I’ve
        nurtured through hands-on learning, self-teaching, and communities like She Codes. I love the mix of logic and
        creativity that coding brings, and the endless opportunity to keep learning and growing.</p>
      <p>I’m also someone who values balance and connection — a dog lover, Pilates regular, and wedding-planning
        enthusiast who’s happiest when surrounded by good people, good coffee, and a new challenge to tackle.</p>
      <p>Thanks for stopping by. Let’s build something great.</p>
